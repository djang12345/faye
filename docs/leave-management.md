## API Endpoints

### Employee Routes
- `GET /leave` - View leave requests

- `GET /leave/credits/my` - Check available credits

### Admin Routes
- `PATCH /leave/{id}/approve` - Approve/reject request

## Business Logic

### Credit Calculation
```php
// Available credits = Total credits - Used credits
$availableCredits = $rule->default_credits - $usedCredits;

// Used credits = Sum of approved requests
$usedCredits = LeaveRequest::where('user_id', $userId)
    ->where('leave_type', $leaveType)
    ->where('status', 'approved')
    ->sum('days_requested');
```

### Request Validation
1. **Credit Check**: Ensure sufficient credits available
2. **Date Validation**: Start date must be today or future
3. **Date Range**: End date must be after start date
4. **Details Required**: Minimum 10 characters

### Approval Process

2. **Add Notes**: Optional admin notes
3. **Decision**: Approve or reject
4. **Credit Deduction**: Only on approval
